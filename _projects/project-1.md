## Overview
Learning about the theoretical model of energetic ion’s absorption; conducting the
experiments to study the energetic ion’s absorption rate influenced by the parallel refractive index, toroidal magnetic field, plasma temperature and density and composing the research paper to publish 

### Result
We got the Effects of the Parallel Refractive Index on the Absorption Rate, Effects of LHW Frequency on the Absorption Rate, Effects of Electron Density of Background Plasma
on the Absorption Rate, Effects of Toroidal Magnetic Field
on the Absorption Rate and the Effects of Electron Temperature of Background
Plasma on the Absorption Coefficient.
