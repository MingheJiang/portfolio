## Overview

This project was the final project of the course ME 495, Embedded Systems in Robotics, at Northwestern University. The main goal of it was letting the Baxter robot autonomously pick objects off of a work surface and place them in a container. The blocks can be in different shapes, colors and placed at any position and orientation on the table.

The whole task could be splited into two parts: **Image Processing** and **Inverse Kinematics**.

All of the code for this project is hosted on this page:
