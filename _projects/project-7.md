## Overview

The regulation of joint mechanics is central to interaction with the surrounding world, and knowledge of these properties is useful for the design and control of biomimetic systems. These mechanics are quantified using perturbations and system identification analyses. 

This project was to develop an attachment that would do the test in the coronal plane (ankle inversion / eversion axis) of a Biodex chair.
