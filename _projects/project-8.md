## Overview

This project was part of the course Robotic Manipulation, at Northwestern University. This project developed a Matlab robotics software library which contains functions including forward and inverse kinematics, inertia matrix, inverse and forward dynamics trajectory and so on.

The video was simulation by letting the UR5 six-joint robot arm follow the quintic trajectory from rest at θ(0) = 0 to θ(T = 1 s) when all joint angles are π/2. Assumed that the joint torques at each joint were constant at 2 Nm.
